Car Part Catalog

Write a small Django application that allows a user to create car parts to be displayed in a catalog.

A car part has a unique part number (up to 10 digits and dashes), a description, and a price. A car part fits one or more vehicles. We sell parts for the following four vehicles: Audi A4, Audi A3, Audi 53, Audi Q5. A user can list all car parts, create a new car part and associate it with one or more vehicles, view a preview of the car part as showing to the customer in the catalog. Use Bootstrap to make the preview more visually appealing. Use the grid framework provided by Bootstrap to make the preview responsive. Commit your code to a Github repo and make it accessible to us. Bonus: Host your code using a hosting solution of your choice and share the link with us.
